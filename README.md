# Memory-Game
Built and deployed the App at https://memorygame-c4cb4.web.app/

So the game is pretty simple.

You can flip two cards to see the image underneath and you see them stay flipped.

If they don't match, then they turn back over at the bottom of the screen.

You're going to see a turn counter as well, so you can see how many turns it takes you to complete

the whole thing.

And finally, if you want to start the game again, you can do it by clicking the button at the top,

and that's going to shuffle the cards so they're all in different places on the grid the next time around.
